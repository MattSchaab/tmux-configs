# TMUX configurations
## What's this for?
The idea of this repo is to have my tmux configurations ready to go just by cloning this into the config directory.

The config is mostly just bindings for pane switching like vim and a rebind of `<C-b>` to `<C-a>`. Plus a nice colorscheme.

Note: This is meant for unix systems, on Windows machines I just use WSL.

## How to use
Remember to run this first
```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```
```
git clone git@github.com:MattSchaab/tmux-configs.git ~/.config/tmux
```
And then run the install shortcut
```
<C-a> I
```
